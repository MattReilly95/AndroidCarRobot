#Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a robotic car and have it be controlled by an Android Application. The car has mulitple sensors on it, in order to keep the car from running into objects. THe robotic car also features a light that will turn on if the surrounding area is dark enough. This acts as somewhat of a headlight. The Arduino code, and the Android Application code is all included in this repository. 

#Prerequisutes before installation
One must have Arduino Studio installed on their computer, as well as an Android Phone with Android version 4.4 or newer on it. In order to put the Arduino Code on the robotic car, one needs to have the car plugged into a the computer through a USB serial port. Once this is done, simply hit the upload and compile button on the Arduino Studio.

In order to install the Android Application onto a device, download the APK from github, and save it onto a google drive that is attached to said device. Once the APK is on the google drive, download the APK directly from google drive onto the phone. Once this is done, change the settings on the phone to allow the installation of unknown apps. With this done, go into your downlaods and just select the APK, this will install the Android App directly onto the phone. 

#How to use the Car
In order to turn on the car, make sure to have charged batteries on the car. Once this is done, plug the wire on the back of the car into the Arduino Board. Once this is done, select the Arduino Robot Application. There will be a email/password prompt. The email/password is case sensitive and is as follows: Username: Hello@gmail.com Password: password. Once you are signed in, make sure bluetooth is turned on, on your device. Select the connect button, make sure to only hit it once, it will either say "Not Connected" or "Connected" on the bottom of the application. Once the car is connected tot he Android Application, you may now control the car with the button controls. 

#This project was built with C, and Java. The IDE's used were Arduino Studio, and Android Studio.
